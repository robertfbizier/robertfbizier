## Hi there
My name is Robert Francisco Bizier.
I am currently working as a fund servicing analyst at JP Morgan Chase in Boston. I recently earned a certificate from the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing through the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society. I am looking to expand my skills in the world of computer and data science. 

On this page you will find some of the projects I am most proud of completing.

You can reach me at the below email:
